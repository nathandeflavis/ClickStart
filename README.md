# ClickStart
A portfolio website.

# What does the project do?
I built a website with 3 pages: a homepage introducing me and my experience on the Click Start programme, links to online profiles and a portfolio of work that I did as part of the programme.

# Why is the project useful?
The project provided an opportunity to apply what I learnt from the Click Start programme, showcase my work to potential employers and hopefully inspire other web development learners.

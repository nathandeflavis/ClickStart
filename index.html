        <h1>Nathan De Flavis</h1>
        <h2>Previous IT Experience</h2>
        <p>I've been doing web development for a youth support charity since June 2023 and for their client since April 2023.
            I did Salesforce development for a cloud software company from July to August 2017,
             and web development for a speech language therapy company from September to October 2019.</p>
        <h2>Why am I doing this course?</h2>
        <p>I'm on the path to a career in web development as covered by the course.
            I welcome <strong>Catch22</strong>'s 6 months of employment support
             and 1 year of <strong>British Computer Society</strong> membership.
            Finally, <strong>Click Start</strong> is a <em>free</em> programme exclusively for people like me,
             as an 18- to 30-year-old within 1 hour away from the West of England and eligible to work in the UK.
        </p>
        <h2>What do I hope to gain from this course?</h2>
        <p>I expect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>refresh my knowledge of web technologies,</li>
            <li>learn about digital marketing</li>
            <li>and improve my ability to work in a team.</li>
        </ul>
